This study focuses on categorizing Amazon product reviews into three sentiment classes: negative, neutral, or positive. The study is framed within the context of Amazon's status as a comprehensive online retailer and web service provider, offering an extensive variety of products. Notably, Amazon features over 12 million items, which balloons to more than 350 million when including Marketplace sellers.

Given the impracticality of manually sorting the enormous volume of customer reviews on Amazon, the study proposes machine learning as a more efficient solution. The dataset titled "Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis," available on Kaggle, forms the basis of the study. This dataset contains 4,915 rows and is structured across 12 columns, with fields such as the reviewer's name, overall product rating, review text, review time, and various statistical measures like the number of days since the review was posted, helpfulness votes, and the Wilson score confidence interval's lower bound.

The research aims to apply machine learning techniques to accurately classify these reviews, providing valuable insights into customer opinions and preferences. Such analysis is crucial for understanding consumer behavior and improving product offerings and services. The study leverages sentiment analysis, a field of study that examines people's sentiments, opinions, and attitudes expressed in text, to analyze the vast array of reviews available on Amazon's platform.
